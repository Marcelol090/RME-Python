# Client Files

Place legacy Tibia client files here when using the in-game preview.

- Required: a `.dat` and `.spr` pair (e.g. `Tibia.dat` + `Tibia.spr`).
- You can also point the editor to a client folder directly via **Assets → Set Assets Folder**.

This folder is intentionally empty in the repository.
